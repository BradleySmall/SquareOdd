# SquareOdd is a kata exercise that takes a number and converts it.
**Copyright Â© 2021 Bradley M. Small**

## **Rules**
The initial numbr is broken down into its digits. Each even digit is passed into the resulting string, and odd ones are first squared, then passed to the string. Lastly the string is converted back to an integer number. 

## **Code**
The source code is Java. The build tool is maven. The unit tests are JUnit. These may be changed later to gradle and Spock.  

## **Suggestions**
This code is intended as an exercise for me to apply my learning of Java. I am quite open to suggestions and recommendations for improvement.

## **License**
If you wish to use any of this code for personal and/or educational purposes you may freely do so as long as you do not claim it as your own. Give a guy a little credit if you use his work.

If you wish to make money with this code, such as publishing it in a tutorial or making a salable product I want a cut of the action. As unlikely as this may be, simply contact me, so we can work out the details.
